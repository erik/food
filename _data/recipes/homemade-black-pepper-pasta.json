  "ingredients": [
    "250 grams all purpose flour",
    "1/2 cup reduced aquafaba (roughly liquid from 2 cans chickpeas)",
    "1 tsp sea salt",
    "1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil",
    "1 tsp freshly ground black pepper"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Simmer aquafaba in saucepan for 5-10 minutes until volume is reduced to half.",
    "Add flour, salt, and black pepper into the bowl of a food processor and pulse to combine. Add the oil and aquafaba and turn the food processor on and run until the mixture forms into a ball. Keep running another 30 seconds.",
    "Turn the dough out onto a clean counter and knead for 1 minute to check the final texture of the dough. It should be firm, but still pliable and not sticky or tacky to the touch.",
    "Wrap the dough with plastic wrap and let rest for at least 30 minutes.",
    "When ready to roll the dough, divide into 3 or 4 portions. Keep pieces of dough that you're not actively using tightly wrapped.",
    "Roll the section of dough with a rolling pin until it's long and rectangular and thin enough to see through.",
    "Dust rolled dough with flour, fold repeatedly, and cut to desired size.",
    "Dump pasta into pot of salted boiling water for 1-2 minutes (until it begins to float to surface)",
    "Place any unused balls of dough in the fridge."
