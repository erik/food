  "ingredients": [
      "### Pancakes",
      "2 cups flour",
      "1 cup boiling water",
      "1/4 cup (ish) sesame seed oil",
      "2 cups sliced scallions",

      "### Dipping Sauce",
      "2 tbsp soy sauce",
      "2 tbsp rice wine vinegar",
      "1 tbsp sliced scallions",
      "1/2 tsp scallion",
      "1/2 tsp ginger",
      "2 tsp sugar",

      "### For Frying",
      "1/4 cup vegetable oil",
      "Salt"
  ],
  "instructions": [
      "Put flour into food processor, drizzle in 3/4 cup boiling water. Process until dough sticks together in a ball, adding more boiling water slowly as necessary.",
      "Transfer ball to a bowl, cover and let rest for 30 minutes (or overnight in the fridge).",
      "Divide the dough into 4 pieces with a dough scraper and roll each into a ball.",
      "Using a rolling pin on a floured surface, flatten each ball into a pancake about 8 inches in diameter. Use a pastry brush to layer on sesame oil, then roll the disk up (like a jelly roll, apparently). Twist this into a spiral, tucking the end underneath, and flatten with your palm.",
      "Repeat this process again, this time adding 1/2 cup scallions after spreading the sesame oil. Repeat the jelly roll and spiral thing again and roll it back out into a disk.",
      "Repeat this process for all remaining balls of dough.",
      "Mix up the ingredients for the sauce (if making), and set aside.",
      "Heat oil in pan, add pancake when hot. Fry for a few minutes, then flip. Cut into slices, season with a bit of salt, and serve."
