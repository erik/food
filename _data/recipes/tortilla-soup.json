  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Preheat the oven to 475 degrees Fahrenheit. Stack the tortillas and slice them into 1/2-inch wide strips.",
    "Coat a baking sheet with a thin layer of oil. Toss the tortilla strips in the oil to coat. Stir periodically, baking until golden brown. While the strips are hot, season them with salt.",
    "Remove the seeds and membranes from the jalapeno (and poblano, if using) and chop the peppers",
    "Place the dried chili pepper onto a baking sheet and bake for about 1 minute. When cool enough to handle, cut the pepper open and remove the seeds.",
    "In a medium pot, heat olive oil on medium until hot. Add the onion, garlic, jalapeno and poblano peppers. Cook 4 to 5 minutes, or until softened, stirring occasionally. Stir in the cumin, then the canned tomatoes and vegetable stock. Simmer for about 3 minutes, then add the hominy, black beans and the seeded chili pepper. Cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until slightly thickened, stirring occasionally. Season to taste.",
    "Garnish with whichever toppings you want and serve."
