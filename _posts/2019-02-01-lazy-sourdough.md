A spin-off of [NYT's sourdough no-knead
recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018028-sourdough-no-knead-bread),
(which itself is a variation of the classic [No-Knead
Bread](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/11376-no-knead-bread)) with a couple
tweaks that helped it turn out better in my limited experience. There's a
little kneading.
