ingredients:
  - "### Stir Fry"
  - 1 package extra firm tofu
  - 3 tablespoons olive oil
  - 1 tablespoon cornstarch
  - Sea salt + Pepper to taste
  - 1 head of broccoli, cut into bite sized pieces
  - 1 small red onion, peeled and thinly sliced
  - 1 cup roasted cashews
  - "### Sauce"
  - 1/3 cup soy sauce
  - 1/3 cup water
  - 3 tablespoons honey or maple syrup
  - 2 tablespoons rice vinegar
  - 1 tablespoon cornstarch
  - 1 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger
  - 1 large clove garlic, minced
instructions:
  - Drain the tofu. Let sit for 10-30 min.
  - Meanwhile, whisk all of the ingredients together in a small bowl (or shake
    them together in a mason jar) until combined.
  - Slice the tofu block lengthwise into 1/2-inch slabs, then cut the tofu into
    bite-sized pieces. Transfer to a large mixing bowl, drizzle evenly with 1
    tablespoon olive oil and toss until coated. Sprinkle the cornstarch plus a
    generous pinch of salt and pepper over the tofu, and toss until evenly
    coated.
  - Heat oil in large non-stick skillet, add about half the tofu, saute until
    golden brown, flip, and repeat. Repeat with remaining tofu.
  - Add the remaining oil to the sauté pan and add the broccoli, red pepper and
    red onion.  Sauté for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until crisp-tender.
  - Add the cashews, stir-fry sauce and cooked tofu to the sauteé pan, and toss
    to combine.  Continue cooking for 1-2 more minutes, until the sauce has
    thickened.
  - Add desired toppings
